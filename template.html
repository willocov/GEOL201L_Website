                        would likely not recognize it as the same planet we inhabit today. The atmosphere was very
                        different from what we breathe today; at that time, it was likely a reducing atmosphere of
                        methane, ammonia, and other gases which would be toxic to most life on our planet today. Also
                        during this time, the Earth's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to
                        form.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">It was early in the Archean that life first appeared on Earth. Our oldest
                        fossils date to roughly 3.5 billion years ago, and consist of bacteria microfossils. In fact,
                        all life during the more than one billion years of the Archean was bacterial. The Archean coast
                        was home to mounded colonies of photosynthetic bacteria called stromatolites. Stromatolites have
                        been found as fossils in early Archean rocks of South Africa and western Australia.
                        Stromatolites increased in abundance throughout the Archean, but began to decline during the
                        Proterozoic. They are not common today, but they are doing well in Shark Bay, Australia (see
                        photo below).

                        During the Proterozoic, the atmosphere and oceans changed significantly. Proterozoic rocks
                        contain many definite traces of primitive life-forms—the fossil remains of bacteria and
                        blue-green algae, as well as of the first oxygen-dependent animals, the Ediacara fauna.F

                        Free oxygen in the atmosphere increased significantly as a result of biological activity during
                        the Proterozoic. By the time eukaryotes became established in the environment, atmospheric
                        oxygen pressure had risen from low values to about 10 percent of the present atmospheric level
                        (PAL). Megascopic eukaryotes first appeared about 2.3 billion years ago and became widespread by
                        about 1.8 billion years ago. Eukaryotes employed a form of respiration and oxidative metabolism;
                        they had a central nucleus that could split into separate sex cells, and so for the first time a
                        mixed and variable genetic code could be passed to younger generations.

                        Early organisms on Earth flourished most easily in the shallow water of continental margins.
                        Such stable continental shelf environments, which were rare in the Archean, developed after 2.5
                        billion years ago, facilitating the growth of photosynthetic organisms and thus oxygen
                        production.

                        The Cambrian period, part of the Paleozoic era, produced the most intense burst of evolution
                        ever known. The Cambrian Explosion saw an incredible diversity of life emerge, including many
                        major animal groups alive today. Among them were the chordates, to which vertebrates (animals
                        with backbones) such as humans belong.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        What sparked this biological bonanza isn't clear. It may be that oxygen in the atmosphere,
                        thanks to emissions from photosynthesizing cyanobacteria and algae, were at levels needed to
                        fuel the growth of more complex body structures and ways of living. The environment also became
                        more hospitable, with a warming climate and rising sea levels flooding low-lying landmasses to
                        create shallow, marine habitats ideal for spawning new life-forms.
                      </p>
                      <h4><b>The Cambrian Explosion</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Nevertheless, the scale of the Cambrian Explosion is likely exaggerated due to the proliferation
                        of hard-bodied animals that fossilized much more readily than their soft-bodied precursors.
                        These included brachiopods, which lived in shells resembling those of clams or cockles, and
                        animals with jointed, external skeletons known as arthropods—the ancestors of insects, spiders,
                        and crustaceans. These toughened-up creatures represented a crucial innovation: hard bodies
                        offering animals both a defense against enemies and a framework for supporting bigger body
                        sizes.

                      <p class="card-text">
                        The Ordovician Period lasted almost 45 million years, beginning 488.3 million years ago and
                        ending 443.7 million years ago.* During this period, the area north of the tropics was almost
                        entirely ocean, and most of the world's land was collected into the southern supercontinent
                        Gondwana. Throughout the Ordovician, Gondwana shifted towards the South Pole and much of it was
                        submerged underwater.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates, including graptolites,
                        trilobites, brachiopods, and the conodonts (early vertebrates). A typical marine community
                        consisted of these animals, plus red and green algae, primitive fish, cephalopods, corals,
                        crinoids, and gastropods. More recently, tetrahedral spores that are similar to those of
                        primitive land plants have been found, suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        From the Lower to Middle Ordovician, the Earth experienced a milder climate — the weather was
                        warm and the atmosphere contained a lot of moisture. However, when Gondwana finally settled on
                        the South Pole during the Upper Ordovician, massive glaciers formed, causing shallow seas to
                        drain and sea levels to drop. This likely caused the mass extinctions that characterize the end
                        of the Ordovician in which 60% of all marine invertebrate genera and 25% of all families went
                        extinct.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Ordovician strata are characterized by numerous and diverse trilobites and conodonts (phosphatic
                        fossils with a tooth-like appearance) found in sequences of shale, limestone, dolostone, and
                        sandstone. In addition, blastoids, bryozoans, corals, crinoids, as well as many kinds of
                        brachiopods, snails, clams, and cephalopods appeared for the first time in the geologic record
                        in tropical Ordovician environments. Remains of ostracoderms (jawless, armored fish) from
                        Ordovician rocks comprise some of the oldest vertebrate fossils.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        The major global patterns of life underwent tremendous change during the Ordovician. Shallow
                        seas covering much of Gondwana became breeding grounds for new forms of trilobites. Many species
                        of graptolites went extinct by the close of the period, but the first planktonic graptolites

                        The Silurian Period occurred from 443 million to 416 million years ago. It was the third period
                        in the Paleozoic Era. It followed the Ordovician Period and preceded the Devonian Period. During
                        this time, continental landmasses were low and sea levels were rising. This meant rich shallow
                        sea ecosystems with new ecological niches. Silurian fossils show evidence of extensive reef
                        building and the first signs that life beginning to colonize the new estuary, fresh water and
                        terrestrial ecosystems.

                        Much of the landmass that would become western North America was under a shallow ocean for much
                        of the Silurian Period. These shallow waters enabled sunlight to penetrate, and marine animals
                        underwent rapid differentiation. Silurian fossils show extensive coral reefs built from tabulate
                        and horn corals with calcium carbonate skeletons. In the early Silurian, a class of jawless
                        fish, Agnatha, similar to modern hagfish and lampreys, was most common. In the mid-Silurian, the
                        first species of Romundina, a Placoderm — a primitive armored fish with a cartilage skeleton —
                        is earliest fish known to have developed jaws.

                        Eurypterids were the apex predators of the Silurian oceans. Eurypterids were arthropods,
                        probably most closely related to modern horseshoe crabs. They had a semi-circular anterior
                        carapace followed jointed section and a long tapering tail. Most species had two pairs of
                        jointed walking legs followed by a pair of paddle-shaped swimming appendages. Some had a spike
                        on the end of their tails, which may have been used to inject venom into prey, giving rise to
                        the common name “sea scorpion.” By the Devonian Period, these animals became the largest known
                        arthropods to ever have lived on Earth.

                        During the Devonian, two major animal groups colonized the land. The first tetrapods —
                        land-living vertebrates — appeared during the Devonian, as did the first terrestrial arthropods,
                        including wingless insects and the earliest arachnids. In the oceans, brachiopods flourished.
                        Crinoids and other echinoderms, tabulate and rugose corals, and ammonites were also common. Many
                        new kinds of fish appeared.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        During the Devonian, there were three major continental masses: North America and Europe sat
                        together near the equator, with much of their current area covered by shallow seas. To the north
                        lay a portion of modern Siberia. A composite continent of South America, Africa, Antarctica,
                        India, and Australia dominated the southern hemisphere.

                      <h4><b>The Devonian seas</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        The Devonian seas were dominated by brachiopods, such as the spiriferids, and by tabulate and
                        rugose corals, which built large reefs in shallow waters. Encrusting red algae also contributed
                        to reef building. In the Lower Devonian, ammonoids appeared, leaving us large limestone deposits
                        from their shells. Bivalves, crinoid and blastoid echinoderms, graptolites, and trilobites were
                        all present, though most groups of trilobites disappeared by the close of the Devonian.

                      <p class="card-text">

                        The Devonian is also notable for the rapid diversification in fish. Benthic, jawless, armored
                        fish are common by the Lower Devonian. These early fish include a number of different groups. By
                        the the Middle Devonian, placoderms, the first jawed fish, appear. Many of these grew to large
                        sizes and were fearsome predators. Of the greatest interest to us is the rise of the first
                        sarcopterygians, the lobe-finned fish, which eventually produced the first tetrapods just before
                        the end of the Devonian.

                      <h4><b> The Devonian landscape</b></h4>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the Devonian Period, colonization of the land was well underway. Before this time, there was
                        no organic accumulation in the soils, resulting in soils with a reddish color. This is
                        indicative of the underdeveloped landscape, probably colonized only by bacterial and algal mats.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the start of the Devonian, early terrestrial vegetation had begun to spread. These plants did
                        not have roots or leaves like most plants today, and many had no vascular tissue at all. They
                        probably spread vegetatively, rather than by spores or seeds, and did not grow much more than a
                        few centimeters tall. These plants included the now extinct zosterophylls and trimerophytes. The
                        early fauna living among these plants were primarily arthropods: mites, trigonotarbids, wingless
                        insects, and myriapods, though these early faunas are not well known.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">

                        By the Late Devonian, lycophytes, sphenophytes, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of
                        these plants have true roots and leaves, and many grew quite tall. The progymnosperm
                        Archaeopteris (see photo above) was a large tree with true wood. It was the oldest known tree
                        until the 2007 identification of Wattieza in 2007. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed
                        plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of so many plant groups and growth forms has been
                        called the "Devonian Explosion." Along with this diversification in terrestrial vegetation
                        structure, came a diversification of the arthropods.

                        During the Mississippian sea lilies dominated the seas and reptiles began to appear on land,
                        along with ferns. Shallow, warm seas supported dense meadows of crinoids and blastoids along
                        with corals, arthropods and mollusks. In North America these meadows left marine limestone
                        deposits, which distinguished the Mississippian from the later coal-rich, Pennsylvanian.
                        Crinoids and their relatives, blastoids, were so widespread in North America that the
                        Mississippian is known as the Age of Crinoids. Because crinoids are filter feeders the seas must
                        have been relatively clear, while their need for high calcium carbonate (CaCO3) concentrations
                        to build their skeletons points to a warm water environment. Bryozoans and brachiopods also
                        thrived in these shallow seas, but trilobites continued to decline. Ammonoids grazed in and on
                        the meadows of less mobile animals. Among the fishes sharks were especially common while bony
                        fishes included coelacanths, acanthodians, and lungfishes. The common open communications
                        between the continental shelves of this Period resulted in a marine fauna which was generally
                        distributed Worldwide.
                        <br><br>
                        In the early Mississippian, diverse scrawny treeless forests replaced the Devonian forests
                        dominated by a single species of tree (Archeopteris). An increasingly lush flora evolved as the
                        period progressed, common plants soon included giant horsetails, tree ferns and conifer-like
                        trees (cordaites). The new flora provided ample food for arthropod herbivores and detrivores
                        such as millipedes and the newly evolved winged insects. These arthropods were in turn food for
                        arthropod and vertebrate predators. Amphibians diversified to include many forms of both
                        semi-aquatic and fully terrestrial species, which fed on the rich arthropod fauna and/or each
                        other.
                        <br><br>
                        Both the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian are now considered to be subperiods of the
                        Carboniferous Period. They are separated in the U.S. because of the different types of fossil
                        deposits commonly found for each subperiod, where much of the midwest was covered by shallow
                        seas giving limestone in the Mississippian, while the Pennsylvanian is dominated by coal
                        deposits from widespread swamps. A major marine extinction event, caused by a drop in sea level
                        that hit ammonoids and crinoids especially hard, distinguishes the Mississippian from the
                        Pennsylvanian periods in marine deposits.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the Devonian ended with a series of glaciations and extinction events, the early
                        Mississippian saw the Earth in a greenhouse climate state with warm temperatures over much of
                        the globe. Gondwana continued its northward drift and collision with Euramerica, building the
                        Appalachian Mountains. Because the colliding landmass straddled the equator warm climatic
                        conditions were common over a wide range of its northern latitudes while southern Gondwana
                        remained glaciated. The drop in sea levels at the end of the Devonian was soon reversed in the
                        Mississippian. The widespread shallow seas on the continents resulted in the extensive limestone
                        and dolomite deposits in this Period, the last Period to see limestone (the major Mississippian
                        rock type) deposited by widespread seas on the North American continent.

                      <p class="card-text">
                        The Pennsylvanian saw the disappearance of the warm, shallow seas of the Mississippian, causing
                        a dramatic change in marine life. The warm, clear seas of the Mississippian gave way to cool,
                        muddy waters resulting in a decline in crinoids from which they never recovered. On land coal
                        swamp forests thrived during this period. The dead plant material was laid down in huge amounts,
                        gradually forming today's coal. Insects ruled the air.
                        <br><br>
                        Tropical forests of this Period provided the plant matter that later became the great coal
                        deposits of America and Europe. These rich deposits make these forest plants some of the best
                        known in Earth’s history. Dominant plants included giant club mosses and horsetails, tree ferns,
                        seed ferns and cordaites (conifer-like trees). Specimens of all but cordaites are displayed in
                        this case. Late Pennsylvanian temperate forests were dominated by cordaites. The vast amont of
                        carbon deposited as coal, rather than carbonate (CO32-), released oxygen into the atmosphere,
                        increasing atmospheric oxygen to 35% (vs. 21% today). This allowed the evolution of giant
                        invertebrates, for example, dragonflies with 70 cm (29 in) wingspans and two-meter long
                        millipedes.
                        <br><br>
                        Pennsylvanian forests and swamps were home to a rich diversity of animals, particularly winged
                        insects. Insects and other arthropods were the main herbivores (vertebrates had not yet evolved
                        the complex digestive strategies needed to eat plants). This Period is known as the Age of
                        Amphibians due to their numbers and variety. These animals ate insects, other arthropods, and
                        each other. A crucial development of this Period was the evolution of the land adapted, membrane
                        enclosed (amniote) egg, allowing animals to live away from water. This advance enabled the
                        eventual conquest of land by reptiles, mammals, and birds.
                        <br><br>
                        Significant glaciation marks the beginning of the Pennsylvanian with a resultant sea-level drop.
                        Earth was in an ice age with a climate much like today—ice on both poles with wet tropics near
                        the equator and temperate regions between. While the main mass of continents was connected,
                        fragments on the edges of the plates continued colliding and merging during this Period,
                        continuing the process of the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea (a process to be
                        completed by the early Triassic). This was also a time of mountain building as all of the
                        continents came together. With mountains came erosion and silt, resulting in muddy shallow
                        waters. As the continents moved about, corresponding climate changes occurred. Towards the end
                        of this period many swamps dried out, leading to the demise of giant plants.

                      <p class="card-text">
                        Permian Period, in geologic time, the last period of the Paleozoic Era. The Permian Period began
                        298.9 million years ago and ended 252.2 million years ago, extending from the close of the
                        Carboniferous Period to the outset of the Triassic Period.
                        <br><br>
                        At the beginning of the period, glaciation was widespread, and latitudinal climatic belts were
                        strongly developed. Climate warmed throughout the Permian times, and, by the end of the period,
                        hot and dry conditions were so extensive that they caused a crisis in Permian marine and
                        terrestrial life. This dramatic climatic shift may have been partially triggered by the assembly
                        of smaller continents into the supercontinent of Pangea. Most of Earth’s land area was
                        incorporated into Pangea, which was surrounded by an immense world ocean called Panthalassa.
                        <br><br>
                        Terrestrial plants broadly diversified during the Permian Period, and insects evolved rapidly as
                        they followed the plants into new habitats. In addition, several important reptile lineages
                        first appeared during this period, including those that eventually gave rise to mammals in the
                        Mesozoic Era. The largest mass extinction in the Earth’s history occurred during the latter part
                        of the Permian Period. This mass extinction was so severe that only 10 percent or less of the
                        species present during the time of maximum biodiversity in the Permian survived to the end of
                        the period.
                        <br><br>
                        Life during the Permian Period was very diverse—the marine life of the period was perhaps more
                        diverse than that of modern times. The gradual climatic warming that took place during the Early
                        Permian (Cisuralian) Epoch (298.9 million to 272.3 million years ago) encouraged great
                        evolutionary expansion (diversification) among both marine and terrestrial faunas that had
                        survived the relatively cold conditions of the Carboniferous Period. Many lineages entering
                        Early Permian times with only a few species and genera progressively diversified into new
                        families and superfamilies as the climate warmed. Communities became increasingly complex, and
                        generic diversity (diversity of organisms at genus level) increased through the midpoint of the
                        Middle Permian (Guadalupian) Epoch (272.3 million to 259.9 million years ago). Within the
                        tropical shallow-water marine communities, significant environmental changes occurring at the
                        end of the Middle Permian Epoch were so abrupt that many groups became extinct, and only a few
                        of the remaining groups survived into the Late Permian (Lopingian) Epoch (259.9 million to 252.2
                        million years ago).
                        <br><br>
                        Terrestrial life in Permian times was closely keyed to the evolution of terrestrial plants,
                        which were the primary food source for land animals. The fossil plant record for the Early
                        Permian Epoch consists predominantly of ferns, seed ferns, and lycophytes (a group of vascular
                        plants containing club mosses and scale trees), which were adapted to marshes and swampy
                        environments. A less abundant Middle and Late Permian fossil record of early coniferophytes (a
                        group of vascular plants containing cycads, ginkoes, and gnetophytes) and protoangiosperms
                        (precursors to flowering plants) suggests a broad adaptation of these plant groups to
                        progressively drier areas.
                        <br><br>
                        Evidence of broad plant diversification also is found in the rapid evolution of insects, which
                        quickly followed plants into new habitats. As these insects adapted to their new surroundings
                        and formed very specialized associations with plants, many new species emerged. Permian insects
                        included at least 23 orders, 11 of which are now extinct.
                        <br><br>
                        The greatest mass extinction episodes in Earth’s history occurred in the latter part of the
                        Permian Period. Although much debate surrounds the timing of the Permian mass extinction, most
                        scientists agree that the episode profoundly affected life on Earth by eliminating about half of
                        all families, some 95 percent of marine species (nearly wiping out brachiopods and corals), and
                        about 70 percent of land species. Many geologists and paleontologists maintain that the
                        extinction events that took place during both the last stage of the Middle Permian Epoch and
                        throughout the Late Permian Epoch, each apparently more severe than the previous one, extended
                        over about 15 million years. Other scientists, however, argue that the extinction interval was
                        much more rapid, lasting only about 200,000 years with the bulk of the species loss occurring
                        over a 20,000-year span near the end of the period.

                        The Triassic Period was the first period of the Mesozoic Era and occurred between 251 million
                        and 199 million years ago. It followed the great mass extinction at the end of the Permian
                        Period and was a time when life outside of the oceans began to diversify.
                        <br><br>

                        At the beginning of the Triassic, most of the continents were concentrated in the giant C-shaped
                        supercontinent known as Pangaea. Climate was generally very dry over much of Pangaea with very
                        hot summers and cold winters in the continental interior. A highly seasonal monsoon climate
                        prevailed nearer to the coastal regions. Although the climate was more moderate farther from the
                        equator, it was generally warmer than today with no polar ice caps. Late in the Triassic,
                        seafloor spreading in the Tethys Sea led to rifting between the northern and southern portions
                        of Pangaea, which began the separation of Pangaea into two continents, Laurasia and Gondwana,
                        which would be completed in the Jurassic Period.
                        <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Marine life</b></h4>

                      The oceans had been massively depopulated by the Permian Extinction when as many as 95 percent of
                      extant marine genera were wiped out by high carbon dioxide levels. Fossil fish from the Triassic
                      Period are very uniform, which indicates that few families survived the extinction. The mid- to
                      late Triassic Period shows the first development of modern stony corals and a time of modest reef
                      building activity in the shallower waters of the Tethys near the coasts of Pangaea.
                      <br><br>

                      Early in the Triassic, a group of reptiles, the order Ichthyosauria, returned to the ocean.
                      Fossils of early ichthyosaurs are lizard-like and clearly show their tetrapod ancestry. Their
                      vertebrae indicate they probably swam by moving their entire bodies side to side, like modern
                      eels. Later in the Triassic, ichthyosaurs evolved into purely marine forms with dolphin-shaped
                      bodies and long-toothed snouts. Their vertebrae indicate they swam more like fish, using their
                      tails for propulsion with strong fin-shaped forelimbs and vestigial hind limbs. These streamlined
                      predators were air breathers and gave birth to live young. By the mid-Triassic, the ichthyosaurs
                      were dominant in the oceans. One genus, Shonisaurus, measured more than 50 feet long (15 meters)
                      and probably weighed close to 30 tons (27 metric tons). Plesiosaurs were also present but not as
                      large as those of the Jurassic Period.
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Plants and insects</b></h4>

                      Plants and insects did not go through any extensive evolutionary advances during the Triassic. Due
                      to the dry climate, the interior of Pangaea was mostly desert. In higher latitudes, gymnosperms
                      survived and conifer forests began to recover from the Permian Extinction. Mosses and ferns
                      survived in coastal regions. Spiders, scorpions, millipedes and centipedes survived, as well as
                      the newer groups of beetles. The only new insect group of the Triassic was the grasshoppers.
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Reptiles</b></h4>

                      The Mesozoic Era is often known as the Age of Reptiles. Two groups of animals survived the Permian
                      Extinction: Therapsids, which were mammal-like reptiles, and the more reptilian Archosaurs. In the
                      early Triassic, it appeared that the Therapsids would dominate the new era. One genus,
                      Lystrosaurus, has been called the Permian/Triassic “Noah,” as fossils of this animal predate the
                      mass extinction but are also commonly found in early Triassic strata. However, by the
                      mid-Triassic, most of the Therapsids had become extinct and the more reptilian Archosaurs were
                      clearly dominant.
                      <br><br>

                      Archosaurs had two temporal openings in the skull and teeth that were more firmly set in the jaw
                      than those of their Therapsid contemporaries. The terrestrial apex predators of the Triassic were
                      the Rauisuchians, an extinct group of Archosaurs. In 2010, the fossilized skeleton of a newly
                      discovered species, Prestosuchus chiniquensis, measured more than 20 feet (6 meters) in length.
                      Unlike their close relatives the crocodilians, Rauisuchians had an upright stance but are
                      differentiated from true dinosaurs by the way that the pelvis and femur were arranged.
                      <br><br>

                      Another lineage of Archosaurs evolved into true dinosaurs by the mid-Triassic. One genus,
                      Coelophysis, was bipedal. Although smaller than the Rauisuchians, they were probably faster as
                      they had a more flexibly jointed hip. Coelophysis also picked up speed by having lightweight
                      hollow bones. They had long sinuous necks, sharp teeth, clawed hands and a long bony tail.
                      Coelophysis fossils found in large numbers in New Mexico indicate the animal hunted in packs. Some
                      of the individuals found had remains of smaller members of the species inside the larger animals.
                      Scientists are unclear as to whether this indicates internal gestation or possibly cannibalistic
                      behavior.
                      <br><br>

                      By the late Triassic, a third group of Archosaurs had branched into the first pterosaurs.
                      Sharovipteryx was a glider about the size of a modern crow with wing membranes attached to long
                      hind legs. It was obviously bipedal with tiny, clawed front limbs that were probably used to grasp
                      prey as it jumped and glided from tree to tree. Another flying reptile, Icarosaurus, was much
                      smaller, only the size of a hummingbird, with wing membranes sprouting from modified ribs.
                      <br><br>


                      <h4><b>Earliest mammals</b></h4>

                      The first mammals evolved near the end of the Triassic Period from the nearly extinct Therapsids.
                      Scientists have some difficulty in distinguishing where exactly the dividing line between
                      Therapsids and early mammals should be drawn. Early mammals of the late Triassic and early
                      Jurassic were very small, rarely more than a few inches in length. They were mainly herbivores or
                      insectivores and therefore were not in direct competition with the Archosaurs or later dinosaurs.
                      Many of them were probably at least partially arboreal and nocturnal as well. Most, such as the
                      shrew-like Eozostrodon, were egg layers although they clearly had fur and suckled their young.
                      They had three ear bones like modern mammals and a jaw with both mammalian and reptilian
                      characteristics.
